Give the pros and cons of each of these using the ideas from our book.
Overall, do you think each one is a net good or net bad?

* `for` loops.
These are not strictly necessary.
Anything you can do with a `for` loop,
you can do with a `while` loop.
* Ruby does not require parentheses when making subroutine calls.
All of the following are valid:
```ruby
fun1(fun2(arg1))
fun1(fun2 arg1 )
fun1 fun2 arg1
```
* Many languages have two types of comments: block and single-line.
For example, using `//` vs `/* */` in Java.
* Inclusion of the `char` (character) data type.
Some languages, such as Python, have only strings.
* C allows `void` functions,
which are functions that do not return anything,
but does not have a `void` type.
```c
void add(int* x) {  // fine to do
    *x = *x + 1;
}

int num;
void val;  // will not compile
```
* In Java, primitive data types and objects are treated differently under
assignment.
```
int x = 5;  // x is a value
House y = new House();  // y is a reference
```

**Stop here for now.**
We'll do the second set in another breakout.

Imagine everyone agreed to design a single new programming language and use
it for all domains.
Give arguments for and against this "one language to rule them all".
Overall, do you think it would be a good idea or not?

Personal preference: do you prefer langauges that end blocks with
* right braces?
* if/fi do/od?
* whitespace?

Next, analyze the pros and cons of each of these endings with ideas from this
class.
